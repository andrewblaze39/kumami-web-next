# Education System Fixes — Changes (latest session)

## Files Created

### `src/hooks/useEducationProgress.ts`
Progress tracking hook for the education system. Reads/writes to Firestore `users/{uid}/education_progress/{levelNum}` subcollection when logged in; falls back to `localStorage` key `kumami_edu_progress` for unauthenticated users. Document structure: `{ completedChapters: number[], sectionProgress: { [chapterIndex: number]: number[] }, updatedAt: serverTimestamp() }`. Exports: `markSectionVisited(chapterIndex, sectionIndex)`, `markChapterComplete(chapterIndex)`, `isChapterComplete(chapterIndex)`, `getChapterSectionProgress(chapterIndex)`, `getProgress()`, `loaded` flag.

### `src/components/education/JourneyLevelCards.tsx`
Client component replacing the inline level-card grid in the journey page. Each `LevelCard` calls `useEducationProgress` for its own level number so it renders live progress (X/N chapters complete, % fill bar, status label "Not started" / "In progress" / "Complete!", check-mark icon when all chapters are done). Extracted as a separate client island so `page.tsx` can keep its `generateMetadata` server export.

### `src/app/education/achievements/page.tsx`
New client page at `/education/achievements`. Shows 5 achievement cards (one per level). Each card calls `useEducationProgress` to determine if all chapters are complete. Earned badges show the level color, a trophy icon, and a green "Earned" pill. Unearned badges are grayed/locked and display chapter progress count or "Complete Level N to unlock". Header shows "X of 5 earned" count.

## Files Modified

### `src/components/education/EducationSidebar.tsx`
- Removed "Dashboard" nav item (dead link, same href as "The Journey").
- Removed "Warm Up" nav item (future feature).
- Removed "Saved" nav item (future feature).
- Removed the "Close menu" button from the sidebar footer entirely.
- Updated "Achievements" href from `/education` to `/education/achievements`.
- Changed brand area from `kūmami WORLD` logo pill to plain `"Education"` text using the existing `.edu-brand-edu` CSS class (turquoise, 800 weight, 22px).
- Updated `learnActive` logic to correctly highlight "Achievements" on its route and "My Courses" on all other `/education/...` routes.

### `src/components/education/EducationTopbar.tsx`
- Removed `style={{ display: 'flex' }}` inline style from the `.edu-menu-btn` hamburger button. The CSS already sets `display: none` on desktop and `display: flex` at `max-width: 900px`; the inline style was overriding the CSS and making the button always visible.

### `src/components/education/EducationArticleRenderer.tsx`
- Imported `useEducationProgress` and `useEffect`.
- Added `handleMarkComplete` callback that calls `markChapterComplete(resolvedChapterIndex)` when the user clicks "Mark complete & continue", "Next chapter", or "Complete level" (both in rail and in section nav).
- Added `useEffect` that pre-fills `visitedSections` from saved Firestore/localStorage progress after the hook loads, so returning users see checkmarks on previously-read sections.
- `goToStep` now calls `markSectionVisited(chapterIndex, sectionIndex)` for each section the user navigates to.

### `src/app/education/[phase]/page.tsx`
- Imported `useEducationProgress`.
- Replaced hardcoded `pct = 0` / `doneCh = 0` with live values derived from `isChapterComplete(ci)` for each chapter slot.
- Chapter status (`'done'` / `'current'` / `'upcoming'`) now reflects real completion — the green check circles in the accordion header are accurate.

### `src/app/education/page.tsx`
- Replaced the inline PHASES level-card grid with `<JourneyLevelCards />`.
- Removed now-unused imports (`BookOpen`, `Clock`, `Trophy`, `ArrowRight`, `PHASES`).

## What the Tester Should Focus On

1. **Progress save/restore** — Log in, read through sections in an article (each section navigation fires `markSectionVisited`). Click "Mark complete & continue" or "Next chapter" on the last section. Reload the page — visited-section checkmarks should persist. Go to `/education/1` — the completed chapter should show a green check in the accordion.

2. **Unauthenticated fallback** — Log out, navigate the same flow. Progress should persist in localStorage across page reloads (check `kumami_edu_progress` key in DevTools > Application > Local Storage).

3. **Achievements page** (`/education/achievements`) — Complete all chapters in a level, then check the badge turns colored with a trophy icon and "Earned" pill. The "X of 5 earned" counter in the header should increment.

4. **Sidebar** — Confirm "Dashboard", "Warm Up", "Saved", and "Close menu" are gone. Confirm the brand shows "Education" in turquoise (not the `kūmami WORLD` pill). Confirm "Achievements" sidebar link navigates to `/education/achievements` and highlights correctly there.

5. **Hamburger button** — On desktop (>900px), the 3-line menu button should be invisible. On mobile (<900px) it should appear and toggle the sidebar.

6. **Journey page** (`/education`) — Level cards should show "Not started / 0/N" initially, update to show in-progress or complete status after chapters are marked complete.

7. **Build** — Confirmed zero errors with `npm run build`.

## Education UI Alignment — Reference Mockup Changes

### Files changed

#### `src/components/education/EducationSidebar.tsx`
- Replaced "Education" brand text with `kūmami WORLD` logo pill (uses existing `.edu-brand-logo` CSS class). Brand link now goes to `/` (home).
- Added Dashboard (Home icon → /education) and Achievements (Trophy icon → /education) to the LEARN group, filling the 4-item LEARN section from the reference mockup.
- Added a MORE nav group with Warm Up (Flame icon + green dot indicator → /education), Saved (Bookmark icon → /education), Settings (Settings icon → /education) — all visual-only stubs.
- `NavLink` updated to spread `flex: 1` on the label and render the green dot for items with `dot: true`.
- `learnActive()` helper ensures Dashboard and Journey don't conflict.
- Removed the standalone Home link that existed above the LEARN group.
- LEVELS section kept intact.

#### `src/app/education/page.tsx` (Journey page)
- Restructured level card JSX from 3-column horizontal layout (marker | body | side) to a flat vertical sequence. Cards now stack: circle marker → tag → title → blurb → meta stats → badge pill → progress bar + CTA.
- `.edu-lv-side` is now at the bottom of each card (not a separate column).

#### `src/app/education/education.css`
- `.edu-journey`: changed to `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr)` — 5-column horizontal grid.
- `.edu-lv-card`: changed to `display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center` — vertical centered cards. Hover animation `translateX(3px)` → `translateY(-3px)`.
- `.edu-lv-marker`: `margin-bottom: 14px` (was `margin-top`).
- `.edu-lv-title`: reduced 20px → 15px for narrower column fit.
- `.edu-lv-meta`: added `justify-content: center`.
- `.edu-lv-side`: changed to full-width stretch with top border separator.
- `.edu-lv-go`: added `justify-content: center`.
- `@media (max-width: 900px)`: journey grid becomes 3 columns.
- Added `@media (max-width: 600px)`: journey grid becomes 1 column.

#### `src/app/education/[phase]/page.tsx` (Course page)
- Added `'instructor'` to the tab union type and TABS array (between Details and FAQ).
- Added Instructor tab content: Kumami Team card with colored avatar circle and bio paragraph.
- Chapter row subtitle now shows `⏱ N sections` and `⏰ Nm` from `linkedArticle.sections.length` and `linkedArticle.minutes`.
- Expanded chapter body now lists `linkedArticle.sections` as "Part 1: [title]" rows using existing `.edu-part` / `.edu-pdot` / `.edu-ptype` classes with "Read" label.
- CTA changed from "Review" to "Revisit chapter".

#### `src/components/education/EducationArticleRenderer.tsx` (Article renderer)
- Rail title changed to flex row showing "In this chapter" left-aligned and `{progressPercent}%` in mint on the right.
- Section items in rail: label gets `flex: 1`, each item now has a `<span className="edu-ptype">Read</span>` badge on the right.
- "Mark complete & continue" CTA added at bottom of rail: links to `nextArticleId` if present, else "Complete level →" linking to level page.
